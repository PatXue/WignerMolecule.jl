\begin{document}

\section{Ferromagnet}
\subsection{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At high temperatures, the average spins are biased towards the x-direction
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tested ground state energies for different directions, no difference
        \item Averaged 10000\^2 random spins, doesn’t seem biased
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bias field behavior near transition point
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
    \item State is ordered below 4.5meV
    \item Transition temperature does not seem affected by system size
    \item At 80x80, can see spin waves (spin correlations peak off gamma)
    \item However, still seems to have a transition at the same temperature, the spin correlation peak suddenly broadens
    \item Initializing in ground state, no longer see spin waves
\end{itemize}

\section{Antiferromagnet-Ferroelectric}
\subsection{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Try sweeping AFM-FE parameter space
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Result}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Orders weakly in annealed runs with no bias
    \item With bias field, system seems to transition to phase at some finite bias field, doesn’t change with system size
    \item Increasing temperature moves transition to higher field
    \item Eta-only runs show strong ordering up to very high temperatures
\end{itemize}

\section{Stripe}
\subsection{Next Steps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In eta-only runs, etas order uniformly in x direction, and energy decreases as temperature increases
    \item Also happens in bias field runs
    \item Also happens in eta-only runs initialized in ground state
    \item Can see M eta correlator fall from ground state value to 0 in MC time
    \item Try different coupling parameters to see if the uniform eta-x phase appears
    \item In eta-only runs, eta correlator decreases with am, and increases with epsilon
    \item Varying the strength of only the J+ coupling, seems increasing its magnitude strengthens the uniform phase
    \item Try cluster or different eta sampling?
\end{itemize}
